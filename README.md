# IndianAirplane-EDA

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) code for the flight prediction project. The project aims to analyze and gain insights from a flight dataset to predict flight prices accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` repo. It consists of historical flight data, including features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and additional information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA code is provided in the `flight_eda.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The notebook covers the following aspects:

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and visualization
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Correlation analysis
- Data insights and conclusions

We encourage you to explore the EDA notebook and enjoy the process of learning and discovering patterns in the flight dataset. The insights gained from the EDA will provide a solid foundation for any future modeling or prediction tasks.

## Requirements

To run the EDA code, you need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using the following command: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'


## Usage

To reproduce the EDA analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone[ https://github.com/joelsiby02/EDA-Flight-Prediction.git]

2. Navigate to the project directory: [cd EDA-Flight-Prediction]

3. Install the required dependencies: [pip install -r requirements.txt]


4. Run the Jupyter Notebook: [jupyter notebook flight_eda.ipynb]


5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and explore the EDA analysis.

Please note that the EDA process prepares the dataset for modeling, and if you decide to build a flight price prediction model in the future, this EDA analysis provides a solid starting point.
